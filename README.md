Algo Sorting Visualizer

Algo Sorting Visualizer is a web-based tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users visualize and understand the functionality of various sorting algorithms. It provides a dynamic, interactive way to explore how different algorithms organize data.

Features

Visualizes Multiple Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Merge Sort

Heap Sort

Insertion Sort

Quick Sort

Selection Sort


Dynamic Visualization:

Shows step-by-step sorting in real-time, with color-coded elements to distinguish between sorted, unsorted, and currently compared elements.


Customizable Speed:

Users can control the speed of the sorting process to observe each step in detail or speed up for a quick view.


Time and Space Complexity:

Displays time and space complexities for each algorithm, helping users understand the efficiency of each sorting method.



How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.


2. Open the index.html file in your browser.


3. Select a sorting algorithm from the options.


4. Use the slider to set the speed of the visualization.


5. Click the “Sort” button to start the algorithm visualization.



Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the webpage.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For implementing and visualizing sorting algorithms.


Future Enhancements

Add more sorting algorithms.

Include sound effects based on element comparisons for a more interactive experience.

Enhance UI for a better user experience.


Getting Started

To run the project, simply open index.html in your preferred web browser. No additional installations are required.
